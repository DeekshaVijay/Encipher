    <div class="row">
    <p>
        A cartoon is a visual form of art that uses simple, exaggerated, and often humorous drawings to tell a story or express an idea. The characters in cartoons usually have big eyes, funny expressions, bright colors, and unusual shapes, which make them look lively and engaging. Cartoons often simplify real-life situations so that the message becomes clear and entertaining.They are commonly used in comic strips, children's shows, animated movies, advertisements, and educational videos. Through cartoons, creators can show emotions dramatically—like super wide smiles, popping eyes, or fast movements—to make the scenes more exciting and funny.
