 <h1>Why do I want to learn HTML?</h1>
 <p>Learning HTML is important to me because it is the foundation of every website on the internet. Whenever we open a webpage, the content, headings, images, links, and layout are all created using HTML. By understanding HTML, I can clearly see how websites are built and gain the ability to structure information in a neat and meaningful way.</p>

<p>HTML also helps me express my creativity. With just a few simple tags, I can design my own webpages, create mini-projects, and build a small online portfolio. It gives me a sense of control and confidence because I can turn my ideas into real webpages without depending on anyone. This motivates me to explore more and improve my skills step by step.</p>

<p>Learning HTML opens the door to many future opportunities. Once I understand HTML, it becomes easier to learn CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and even advanced web development frameworks. In today’s digital world, knowing how the web works is a huge advantage, whether for studies, career, or personal growth. That is why I am excited to learn HTML and start my journey in web development.</p>
